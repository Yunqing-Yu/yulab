Wild relatives of crops provide a rich source of morphological and genetic diversity that can be harnessed to understand the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. Our lab focuses on the Poaceae (grass) family—one of the largest plant families and home to all major cereal crops, including wheat, rice, maize, and barley—to investigate the development and evolution of grain disarticulation, a key trait in domestication. We aim to generate knowledge and tools that enable the effective use of wild cereal relatives for crop improvement.

# **Comparative Plant Development Lab**

The Yu lab is a group of researchers investigating the comparative development of plant morphological traits at both the cellular and genetic levels. We aim to uncover how these variations influence the biological functions of plant structures, with a particular focus on traits of agronomic importance. Our group is part of the [International Barley Hub](https://barleyhub.org/) based at the [James Hutton Institute](https://www.hutton.ac.uk).

Our research leverages the wild relatives of cereal crops to study the comparative development of agronomically relevant traits, using a combination of cellular and molecular biology, genetics, gene editing, and phylogenetic approaches.
